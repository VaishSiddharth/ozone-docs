!!! question "What is an OpenMRS lab results bundle?"

    Lab results are represented in OpenMRS as observations (obs). A lab results bundle is a set of OpenMRS obs that can be either free-text, numeric or coded data types.

## Flows Details

### **1** &nbsp; OpenMRS Patient → SENAITE Client

A patient in OpenMRS is synchronized as a corresponding client in SENAITE.

    a["OpenMRS patient"]-- 1-to-1 -->b["SENAITE client"]
```

### **2** &nbsp; OpenMRS Lab Test Order → SENAITE Analysis Request

As soon as a lab test is first ordered for a patient in OpenMRS, an analysis request is created in SENAITE for the corresponding client.

```

### **3** &nbsp; SENAITE Analyses ⭆ OpenMRS Lab Results Bundle

When an analysis request's analyses (or lab results) have been submitted, verified and published in SENAITE, the lab results bundle is saved into OpenMRS as an array of obs.
